# CODESOFT-TASK---IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements â€” sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset contains 150 samples from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with 50 samples for each class.
